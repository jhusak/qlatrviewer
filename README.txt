qlatrviewer
===========

<https://github.com/jhusak/qlatrviewer>


This is a Quick Look plugin that shows the contents of an ATR - disk image file.

Please download qlatrviewer.qlgenerator1.0.zip and unzip it.
To install the plugin, just drag it to /Library/QuickLook (for all users) or ~/Library/QuickLook (for current user only).
You may need to create that folder if it doesn't already exist.
Might be nesessary to invoke "qlmanage -r" from terminal, or simply reboot.

The file extension ATR is shared among ATR image file and other file contents
thus may collide with them.

Tested with MacOS X 10.6 to 10.11.
