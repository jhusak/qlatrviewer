qlatrviewer
===========

<http://code.google.com/p/qlatrviewer/>

This is a Quick Look plugin that shows the contents of an ATR - disk image file.

To install the plugin, just drag it to /Library/QuickLook or ~/Library/QuickLook.
You may need to create that folder if it doesn't already exist.

The file extension ATR is shared among ATR image file and other file contents
thus may collide with them.
