qlatrviewer
===========

<https://github.com/jhusak/qlatrviewer>


This is a Quick Look plugin that shows the contents of an ATR - disk image file.

Please download qlatrviewer.qlgenerator.zip and unzip it.
To install the plugin, just drag it to /Library/QuickLook (for all users) or ~/Library/QuickLook (for current user only).
You may need to create that folder if it doesn't already exist.
Might be nesessary to invoke "qlmanage -r" from terminal, or simply reboot.

The file extension ATR is shared among ATR image file and other file contents
thus may collide with them.

The library used sometimes does not recognise atrs. You may try to fix it :)

Tested with MacOS X 10.6 to 10.14.6
